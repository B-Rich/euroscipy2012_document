 Budget estimates
==================

This chapter provides budget estimates based on the experience from previous
years and from the local organizers.

We have included the main income that comes from the registration fees. We are
looking actively for sponsors to cover the basic expense for the conference
(venue and catering).

Some sponsoring is received as direct support of the travel expenses to keynote
speakers which simplifies our accounting.

Venue

The conference will take place at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), on
the campus Solbosch. The rooms for the conference are provided at the cost for
members of the university as two organizers are part of the ULB.
