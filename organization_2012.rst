Rooms
=====

All rooms require

* A video projector.
* Sound amplification.
* Possibly power outlets along the desks to connect the laptops of participants.

Tutorials
---------

The tutorials are held on days 1 and 2 (for 2012, thursday 23rd Aug. and friday,
24th Aug.) in two rooms that can hold more at least 120 people. The lectures
require

The tutorials consist of two parallel tracks of two days, held in two rooms

* 1 room for the "beginner" track.
* 1 room for the "advanced" track.

Main Conference track
---------------------

The main conference track takes place on days 3 and 4 (for 2012, saturday 25th
Aug. and sunday 26th Aug.). The capacity of the room should be of more about 250
people.

It consists of a single track on the two days, each day beginning by a keynote
talk. Then, there is room for contributed talks and a poster session. The talks
are selected by the program committee and last 30 minutes.

Satellites meetings
-------------------

Satellite meetings are held the day following the main conference track. In
2011, satellite meetings have been held on Physics and Neuroscience. The
attendance is expected to be lower than for the other parts of the conference,
with 50-100 participants per meeting.

Sprints
-------

Sprints are events allowing participants to collaborative projects to work in
the same physical location. The sprints require 3-4 rooms for 10 to 30 people
for collaborative work around tables, with video projector and amplification and
possibly power outlets along the desks to connect laptops.

* Day 6: Tuesday 28th Aug. 2012.
* Day 7: Wednesday 29th Aug. 2012.

General considerations
----------------------

We appreciate that the premises (especially those in day 3 and J 4 J, the conference itself) are

* Comfortable
* Of quality (to be equal to what we had in Paris this year at ENS)
* Close to each other to allow the circulation
* Close to a space that can be used for the breaks on mid-morning and
  mid-afternoon and lunch / cold buffet lunch, and that this space is adequate to
  receive posters on billboards (20-40)

Catering
========

During the conference, lunches and coffee breaks are provided.

Lunch
-----

For lunch, we plan a buffet with "mange-debout" tables.

Coffee breaks
-------------

Coffee breaks will provide, as expected, coffee.

Registration
============

Registration of participants will be taken care of by Logilab. Logilab manages
the http://www.euroscipy.org/ website. A online payment system is available.
This system has already been used in 2011 and Nicolas Chauvat of Logilab agrees
to take care of it for 2012.

Program management
==================

The program is managed, for the tutorials, main track and satellites, by their
respective program chairs. The program for the satellites is left fully to
satelitte organizers.

Sponsoring
==========

The sponsoring for EuroSciPy has, in previous years, been very light because the
hosting institutions provided infrastructure for free. For 2012 however, it is
planned to ask sponsoring to private and public sponsors. The accounting will be
done by Professor Hugues Bersini's lab for sponsor money and transactions within
the ULB. This is a necessary condition to manage funding from possible Belgian
funding sources.
